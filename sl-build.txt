usage: %MAIN% [options]

Build a node application package.

With no options, the default depends on whether a git repository is
detected or not.

If a git repository is detected, the default is to install and commit
the build results to the "deploy" branch, which will be created if it
does not already exist.

If no git repository is detected, the default is to bundle, install,
and pack the build results into a `<package-name>-<version>.tgz` file.

Options:
  -h,--help       Print this message and exit.
  -v,--version    Print version and exit.
  -i,--install    Install dependencies (without scripts, by default).
  --scripts       If installing, run scripts (to build addons).
  -b,--bundle     Modify package to bundle deployment dependencies.
  -p,--pack       Pack into a publishable archive (with dependencies).

Git specific options:
  -c,--commit     Commit build output (branch specified by --onto).
  --onto BRANCH   Branch to commit build results to, creating if
                  necessary. ("deploy", by default).
